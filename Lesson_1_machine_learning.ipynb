        "# **1 - Basics**\n",
        "## **Getting Started With Programming**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Programming:**\n",
        "- Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute.\n",
        "- It allows us to automate tasks, analyze data, and build software applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Typical steps in programming:**\n",
        "1. Define the Problem: Understand what needs to be solved.\n",
        "2. Plan the Solution: Outline the logic and steps required.\n",
        "3. Choose a Programming Language: Select the appropriate language for implementation.\n",
        "4. Write the Code: Implement the logic using the chosen programming language.\n",
        "5. Test the Code: Run and verify if the code produces the expected results.\n",
        "6. Debug and Fix Errors: Identify and correct any mistakes or unexpected behaviors.\n",
        "7. Optimize and Refactor: Improve the code for efficiency and maintainability.\n",
        "8. Deploy the Program: Make the program available for use.\n",
        "9. Maintain and Update: Regularly check and update the program as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Writing and Running Code:**\n",
        "- A program is typically written in a text editor and executed using a compiler or interpreter, depending on the language.\n",
        "- Some languages (like Python) are interpreted, while others (like C++) require compilation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Read: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Debugging and Error Handling:**\n",
        "- Errors are common in programming. Debugging involves finding and fixing errors (bugs). Common types of errors include:\n",
        "  - Syntax Errors: Mistakes in the code structure.\n",
        "  - Logical Errors: The code runs but produces incorrect results.\n",
        "  - Runtime Errors: Issues that occur during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Best practices in programming:**\n",
        "1. Write Readable Code: Use meaningful variable names and comments.\n",
        "2. Follow the DRY Principle: Don't Repeat Yourselfâ€”reuse code through functions and modules.\n",
        "3. Test Your Code: Check for errors and edge cases before deploying a program.\n",
        "4. Use Version Control: Keep track of changes using tools like Git.\n",
        "5. Keep Functions and Modules Small: Ensure that functions perform a single task and keep code modular.\n",
        "6. Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement proper exception handling to prevent crashes.\n",
        "7. Optimize for Performance: Use efficient algorithms and data structures.\n",
        "8. Write Documentation: Maintain proper documentation to make the code understandable.\n",
        "9. Follow Coding Standards: Adhere to industry best practices and style guides.\n",
        "10. Continuously Learn and Improve: Stay updated with new programming trends and best practices.\n",
